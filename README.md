# BackPacks [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/michael1011/BackPacks.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/michael1011/BackPacks)

## A backpack plugin for Bukkit/Spigot 1.11, 1.10 and 1.9

**Requirements:**

* Bukkit/Spigot 1.9, 1.10 or 1.11 (older versions *might* work too)
* Java 7 or higher
* A MySQL database

This plugin contains 4 different types of backpacks:

* normal: this type is like a chest
* ender: opens the enderchest of the player
* crafting: opens a crafting table
* furnace: is a portable furnace that smelts things automatically

You can create as many backpacks as you want and every backpack is customizable. You can set the name, lore (description), material and the crafting recipe. If its a backpack of the type 'normal' it's also possible to set the slots of it. You can find a sample configuration [here](https://github.com/michael1011/BackPacks/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml).

Read more about the configuration [here](https://github.com/michael1011/BackPacks/wiki/).
